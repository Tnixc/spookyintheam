I am currently working as a developer and contributor at [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin). 

I initially started out by porting [joplin](https://github.com/catppuccin/joplin), but now I am also maintaing ports for [vscode](https://github.com/catppuccin/vscode), [sublime-text](https://github.com/catppuccin/sublime-text) and [bat](https://github.com/catppuccin/bat). I have also contributed and ported [spicetify](https://github.com/catppuccin/spicetify).

I am currently working on [command line installer for Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/cli) with my friends over at Catppuccin and we're writing this in Go.

    <h2>My previous projects</h2>

I have previously prepared some projects, most of which were either personal or were created for university submissions. I mostly worked on writing the middleware and backends of these projects but also had some role in the frontend as well. 

```admonish info 
These projects either range from good to war crimes against programming. There is no in-between.
