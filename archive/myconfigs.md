    <h2> Tools and Languages I use</h2>
</div>

**Languages** \
__Go:__: Recently started this language and I've been liking it a lot. Go is on its way to become a language I code in daily. Quite fun. \
__Python:__ Have been using it for sometime now and have written various middlewares for websites in Django. \
__C++:__ Started out in programming with this language so its the closest to my heart. Sad I haven't had the oppurnity to make some big projects in it. 


**Tools** \
__Docker:__ Recently started using Docker to containerise some projects. Stay tuned ðŸ˜†
