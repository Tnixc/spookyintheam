<h1 align=center">Hello! I am Himanshu 👋️</h1>
<h3>Cloud Solutions Architect ☁️</h3>
</div>

This is something of a personal archive, where I post what I do, what I have done and what I am learning. This just might document my journey as a developer, an architect and a cloud enthusiast. This was long due but the main idea for the whole archive was stolen shamelessly from [Hamothy](https://github.com/sgoudham). <img src="images/keksmile.webp" width="20px">

## About me 🤓️
- A 4th year student pursuing CSE from India. I am an AWS certified Solutions Architect. You can check out my [AWS badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/e1d7f299-977a-4b6f-a94c-992ce725f5c1/public_url)!
- Linux geek and a big open source fanatic! Obligatory to say I use Arch btw, right? 😸
- I mainly program in Python and recently started coding in Go and I might just switch completely to Go. 

## What do I do when not...coding?
Now that you ask, I mostly spend my time cooped up in my room (like every other engineering student, lol) reading books. I read a lot of books, and by a lot I mean _a lot_. I'll be making a list of books I read this year and keep it updated whenever I get the time to do that. 

Also a chad rock music enjoyer and a big Arctic Monkeys and Phoebe Bridgers fan. My music taste ranges from absolute trash to God-like. There's no in-between here. 😆
